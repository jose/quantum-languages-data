There are a lot of fairly good languages already; another language for the sake of it would not be helpful. But if a language developer has an insight around how to balance the layers of abstractions and manage quantum information in a novel, elegant way then they should pursue it. Here’s the reasoning behind that statement with a contemporary example: Python’s a beautiful language with some wonderful design and features, but it took decades of research, many failed languages, and a few successful ones (and enhancements to the hardware) to get to a language like Python. We’re not there yet with quantum languages and I don’t believe that the “weirdness” of quantum information is the problem — it’s the abstractions. They can make it intuitive.  "
